    "# How to add summary of the conversation history\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most common use cases for persistence is to use it to keep track of conversation history. This is great - it makes it easy to continue conversations. As conversations get longer and longer, however, this conversation history can build up and take up more and more of the context window. This can often be undesirable as it leads to more expensive and longer calls to the LLM, and potentially ones that error. One way to work around that is to create a summary of the conversation to date, and use that with the past N messages. This guide will go through an example of how to do that.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will involve a few steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Check if the conversation is too long (can be done by checking number of messages or length of messages)\n",
    "- If yes, the create summary (will need a prompt for this)\n",
    "- Then remove all except the last N messages\n",
    "\n",
    "A big part of this is deleting old messages. For an in depth guide on how to do that, see [this guide](../delete-messages)"

A few thoughts on their winning ways:\\n\\n- The Celtics are one of the most storied franchises in the NBA, with 17 championship titles, the most of any team. Their history of winning is impressive.\\n\\n- This season, the Celtics have the best record in the Eastern Conference and are contending for another title. Their consistent ability to compete for championships year after year is admirable.\\n\\n- Players like Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown have emerged as elite talents, helping keep the Celtics among the NBA's elite teams. Their young core has a lot of potential.\\n\\n- Coaching stability with Brad Stevens and now Joe Mazzulla has allowed the Celtics to maintain their high level of play over time.\\n\\nI can see why you enjoy following a team that wins as much as the Celtics do. Their sustained success and ability to compete for championships must make them very fun to root for.
