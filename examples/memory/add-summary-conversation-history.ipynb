    "# How to add summary of the conversation history\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most common use cases for persistence is to use it to keep track of conversation history. This is great - it makes it easy to continue conversations. As conversations get longer and longer, however, this conversation history can build up and take up more and more of the context window. This can often be undesirable as it leads to more expensive and longer calls to the LLM, and potentially ones that error. One way to work around that is to create a summary of the conversation to date, and use that with the past N messages. This guide will go through an example of how to do that.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will involve a few steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Check if the conversation is too long (can be done by checking number of messages or length of messages)\n",
    "- If yes, the create summary (will need a prompt for this)\n",
    "- Then remove all except the last N messages\n",
    "\n",
    "A big part of this is deleting old messages. For an in depth guide on how to do that, see [this guide](../delete-messages)"

A few reasons why the Celtics have been so successful:\\n\\n- Great coaching - They've had legendary coaches like Red Auerbach, Doc Rivers, and now Ime Udoka who have gotten the most out of their talented rosters.\\n\\n- Sustained excellence - Unlike some teams that have short windows of success, the Celtics have been a perennial contender for the majority of their history.\\n\\n- Ability to reload - Even when they lose star players, the Celtics have done a great job of rebuilding and restocking their roster to remain competitive.\\n\\n- Knack for developing talent - Players like Larry Bird, Kevin McHale, and others have blossomed into all-time greats under the Celtics' system.\\n\\nThe Celtics' winning culture and pedigree as an organization is really admirable. It's no wonder they have such a passionate fan base like yourself who takes pride in their sustained success over the decades.
